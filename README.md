## üìå About This Repo

This is an ongoing project where I will be adding practical examples and code for all major AdMob ad formats, including:

- Banner Ads  
- Interstitial Ads  
- Rewarded Ads  
- Native Ads  

Each implementation will follow Google's latest policies and monetization strategies to ensure the best results in terms of both user experience and revenue.

Stay tuned for upcoming commits where you'll find easy-to-follow and reusable code for all ad types.
